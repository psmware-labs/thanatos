The first time opening the container will take a while, as the required images need to be downloaded from the [Docker Image Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), to build the container.

The container will be fully loaded and ready to use when the icon in the bottom left switches from **â†» Opening Remote...** to **Dev Container: THANATOS**.
